\section{IoT Software Update Manager Prototype}

We provide an open-source implementation of the SUIT workflow which we integrated in the main branch o RIOT~\cite{RIOT-suit}, a common operating system for low-power IoT devices~\cite{baccelli2018riot} which we used as base for our  microcontainer prototypes.

Our update manager prototype is generic in the sense that it enables both to manage the secure update of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Software modules (i.e. OTA microcontainer update);
    \item Firmware (FOTA updates)
\end{itemize}
